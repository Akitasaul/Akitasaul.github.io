       “In 100-200 words, create a poem about a queen that smokes” ChatGPT, June 1, 2025, https://chat.openai.com.

        <br />
            
         <br />   
The moon would blush when the Sun drew near, <br />
A golden grin from ear to ear.  <br />
He’d light her face at break of dawn,  <br />
Then slip away- and she’d be gone.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Below, upon a bed of grass <br />
A cat below, with fur like night, <br />
Watched from his throne bathed in light.  <br />
“Why not me? The feline cried. <br />
 With narrowed eyes and prickled pride. <br />
<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Their love, a dance of hide and seek,<br />
 A fleeting kiss each twilight peak. <br />
The sky their stage, the stars their song. <br />
But oh, the wait- it felt so long.
